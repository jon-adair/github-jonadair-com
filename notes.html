	<p>Another test site on github.</p>
	<p>Playing around with Visual Studio Code. So <i>this</i> Intellisense works.</p>
	<p>Now trying <em>Working Copy</em>. How much can I do without the IAP? Well, I can't commit changes. So maybe time to spend some $. Or now I'm editing in Buffer but it's a file share from Working Copy. Ok cool, Buffer has a vim mode. Plus it has syntax highlighting where Working Copy is just a dumb text editor. At least it understands autoindent. Oh, wait, Working Copy <em>does</em> do syntax highlighting. I just had it on plain text. Still can't figure out how to get this side by side with Safari preview.</p>
